# Space-Propulsion
### Installation
The program uses the basic MATLAB Toolbox.

## Project
The project was to size a feasible water primary propulsion system which has the highest performances. The tradeoff was between the combustion chamber temperatures and pressures, the specific impulse and the thrust. A Pareto analysis has been conducted in order to select the optimal solution.
